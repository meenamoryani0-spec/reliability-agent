# Project implementation instructions

Read README.md and docs/HANDOFF.md before extending the application.

- Keep all new project files, virtual environments, caches, and logs on D:.
- Build incrementally and run each component and its local tests before extending it.
- User clarification on 2026-10-10: API credentials must not block local development. Use mocks/local fixtures; defer real provider tests until credentials are supplied.
- Phases 1 and 3 are verified locally; website DNS/HTTP/TLS also passed an example.com public smoke check. The Phase 2 client passes mocked tests; real Nebius connectivity remains unverified. The next build phase is Playwright business-flow checks.
- Do not claim real integrations or the complete application work until live provider and end-to-end validation pass.
- Follow the handoff's Python/FastAPI backend-first order; no empty future modules.
- Check current official provider documentation before implementing API adapters.
- Keep credentials in environment variables; never commit .env or print secrets.
- Separate read checks from write actions. No arbitrary shell or SQL tools for the model.
- Unknown/check-failed is different from unhealthy. Require evidence for root causes.
- Never resolve an incident without successful recovery verification.
- Run scripts/test.ps1 and a live HTTP smoke test for backend milestones.
- Commit verified stable milestones; report untested integrations accurately.
- Docker is optional until the backend host is chosen; it is not needed for Phase 1.
